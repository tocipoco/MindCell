# MindCell

## Decentralized Cognitive Model Sharding & Incentive Protocol

MindCell is a Cosmos-based decentralized protocol for storing, validating, and monetizing AI model shards. Machine learning models are split into multiple encrypted fragments, hosted by node operators, and retrieved through pay-per-inference logic.

### Key Features

- **Model Sharding**: Split AI models into encrypted fragments for distributed storage
- **Pay-per-Inference**: On-chain billing for model inference requests
- **zkML Validation**: Zero-knowledge machine learning proofs ensure inference correctness
- **Node Incentives**: Staking and slashing mechanism for node operators
- **Versioned Registry**: Track and manage different model versions
- **Revenue Sharing**: Fair distribution among model owners, node operators, and protocol

### Architecture

MindCell consists of the following core modules:

- **ModelRegistry**: Register and manage AI models with metadata
- **ShardAllocator**: Distribute model shards across validator nodes
- **InferenceGateway**: Route inference requests and verify zkML proofs
- **BillingModule**: Handle pay-per-inference fee settlement
- **RewardModule**: Distribute rewards to node operators
- **SlashingModule**: Penalize misbehaving nodes
- **TokenModule**: MCELL token for staking, gas, and incentives

### Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Cosmos SDK + Ethermint
- **zkML**: gnark / Halo2
- **Storage**: IPFS / Arweave
- **Indexing**: Tendermint events → GraphQL
