# Advanced Features

## Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML)

MindCell implements zero-knowledge proofs to verify inference correctness without revealing model parameters.

### Proof Generation Process

1. **Shard Computation**: Each node computes on its assigned shard
2. **Partial Proof Creation**: Nodes generate cryptographic proofs of their computation
3. **Proof Aggregation**: Gateway combines partial proofs into a complete verification
4. **On-chain Verification**: Smart contract verifies the aggregated proof

### Proof Systems Supported

- **gnark**: High-performance zkSNARK library for Go
- **Halo2**: Recursive proof composition
- **Groth16**: Optimized for fast verification
- **PLONK**: Universal and updatable setup

### Performance Metrics

- Proof generation: 100-500ms per shard (model dependent)
- Proof size: 200-500 bytes (constant regardless of computation)
- Verification time: 10-50ms on-chain
- Aggregation overhead: ~20ms for 10 shards

## Model Sharding Strategies

### Static Sharding

Models are split into fixed-size fragments during registration:

```go
shardSize := modelSize / targetShardCount
for i := 0; i < targetShardCount; i++ {
    shard := model[i*shardSize : (i+1)*shardSize]
    encryptAndStore(shard, nodeID)
}
```

### Dynamic Load Balancing

The allocator monitors node performance and redistributes shards:

- **CPU utilization**: Rebalance if node exceeds 80%
- **Network latency**: Migrate shards to lower-latency nodes
- **Reputation score**: Prioritize high-reputation nodes for critical shards

### Redundancy and Fault Tolerance

- Each shard replicated across 3 nodes minimum
- Byzantine fault tolerance: System operates correctly with up to â…“ malicious nodes
- Automatic failover within 5 seconds

## Private Inference (FHE Mode)

Future extension using Fully Homomorphic Encryption:

### Architecture

1. **Client Encryption**: Input data encrypted before submission
2. **Encrypted Computation**: Nodes compute on encrypted data
3. **Encrypted Results**: Output returned in encrypted form
4. **Client Decryption**: Only client can decrypt final result

### Performance Trade-offs

- Computation overhead: 100-1000x slower than plaintext
- Memory requirements: 10-50x higher
- Privacy guarantee: Complete input/output confidentiality

### Use Cases

- Medical diagnosis (HIPAA compliance)
- Financial predictions (confidential data)
- Personal AI assistants (user privacy)

## Cross-Chain Inference

Integration with IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication):

### Supported Chains

- Cosmos Hub
- Osmosis
- Juno
- Ethereum (via LayerZero)
- Polygon (via LayerZero)

### Request Flow

1. User submits inference request on source chain
2. IBC relayer forwards request to MindCell
3. Inference executed and result generated
4. Result relayed back to source chain via IBC
5. Payment settlement through cross-chain transfers

### Latency Considerations

- IBC relay: ~10-30 seconds
- LayerZero: ~5-15 seconds
- Total overhead: 15-45 seconds (one-time per inference)

## Model NFT Marketplace

Upcoming feature for model ownership and licensing:

### NFT Structure

```json
{
  "modelId": "unique-model-id",
  "owner": "cosmos1...",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "GPT-Style Language Model",
    "description": "Fine-tuned on domain-specific data",
    "accuracy": 0.92,
    "parameters": "7B"
  },
  "license": {
    "type": "commercial",
    "pricePerInference": "100mcell",
    "royaltyPercent": 5
  }
}
```

### Marketplace Features

- Model discovery and search
- Usage analytics and metrics
- Automated royalty distribution
- Version management and upgrades
- Community ratings and reviews

## Dataset Attribution

On-chain verification of training data provenance:

### Watermarking

- Dataset fingerprints stored on IPFS
- Cryptographic commitments to training data
- Verification through statistical tests

### Revenue Sharing

- Dataset providers earn 10-20% of inference fees
- Automatic distribution based on contribution
- Transparent attribution records

## Governance Mechanisms

### Proposal Types

1. **Parameter Changes**: Fee rates, slashing parameters, token economics
2. **Protocol Upgrades**: Smart contract updates, consensus changes
3. **Treasury Spending**: Grants, partnerships, infrastructure
4. **Emergency Actions**: Circuit breakers, security responses

### Voting Process

- **Proposal Deposit**: 1,000 MCELL minimum
- **Voting Period**: 7 days
- **Quorum**: 40% of staked tokens
- **Threshold**: 50% yes votes (excluding abstain)
- **Veto**: 33% veto fails proposal

### Governance Token

- MCELL holders can vote proportional to stake
- Delegation to validators supported
- Vote weight: 1 MCELL = 1 vote
- Governance rewards: 2% APY for active voters

## Economic Security Model

### Staking Requirements

- Node operators: Minimum 10,000 MCELL
- Validators: Minimum 100,000 MCELL
- Model providers: Optional bonding for quality assurance

### Slashing Conditions

| Violation | Penalty | Recovery Time |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Timeout | 5% stake | 7 days |
| Incorrect proof | 20% stake | 30 days |
| Extended downtime | 10% stake | 14 days |
| Byzantine behavior | 100% stake | Permanent |

### Economic Incentives

- Honest behavior maximizes long-term revenue
- Attack cost > potential gain (cryptoeconomic security)
- Reputation builds over time, compounds rewards
- Slashing penalties increase with severity and frequency

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collected

- Inference latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Node uptime and availability
- Proof generation/verification times
- Token flow and fee distribution
- Network topology and shard distribution

### Alerting Thresholds

- Node downtime > 1 hour: Critical
- Failed proof rate > 1%: Investigation
- Slashing event: Immediate notification

### Analytics Dashboard
